# ThetaPad
## A Free Tool For Artists

### Version 2 is live! 
####Only a few main features are implemented so far, but more are coming. Check it out at [**ThetaPad.art**](https://thetapad.art/)!

*Note: This project is still under construction. I'm in the process of adding features, and 
there are still few minor bugs to iron out.*

## Tools for Artists
ThetaPad is a tool for artists. It allows artists to upload their reference image and 
make measurements on them. For example, it in drawing/painting people, sometimes you want to know 
things like 'how many eyes wide is the mouth?' or 'what is the angle of the right leg relative 
to the left?' and ThetaPad's main purpose is to allow artists to get the answers to these 
question as quickly and easily as possible.


## Motivation
ThetaPad was primarily made to help eliminate some barriers to entry for aspiring visual artists. 
Professional visual artists of all kinds often use techniques such as griding, filtering, and measuring 
their reference photos, and they usually use software like Photoshop to do that. Photoshop is 
expensive, and it's not really even meant for those uses, adding not only a monetary barrier, but 
a skill barrier as well. This means many young artists, especially those living in poor and 
underprivileged communities, can't compete with the professionals. ThetaPad is my attempt to provide 
some of the tools used by professionals all in one website.
